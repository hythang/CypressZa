It was originally developed in 2004 and now, after 14 years, it is still hard to implement it correctly. Tests are often flaky, painful to debug, and the overall developer experience is rather poor. But for many years there wasn't another choice, until Cypress was born. Cypress tries to solve the biggest testing challenges, e.g. painless setup, easy to write tests, support for async testing, performance, and a good understanding of why tests fail. Cypress is made from scratch focusing on developer experience, debugability and consistency. In this talk, we'll look at how to get started with Cypress and dive into some basic tests. We'll also see how to work with http requests, access the Local Storage and explore the debugging capabilities of Cypress.
